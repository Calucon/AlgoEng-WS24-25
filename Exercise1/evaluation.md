# 1\. Assessment

Not passed

# 2\. General

* The report needs some fine-tuning.
* Classical MergeSort is missing! 
* The run.sh script does not execute the algorithms and does not produce the input (and throws compile errors)!
* No clear testcase nor instructions on how to run the code. This alone will lead to an immediate fail next time!

# 3\. Report

## Abstract & Introduction

* Fine.

## Algorithm & Implementation

* You should use two files and exchange their roles after each merging level is done. This way you do no need another file.

## Experimental Evaluation

* Where is the classical MergeSort?
* It would be more interesting to have the average running time of EM MergeSort compared to the average time required by classical MergeSort. 
* You could also decrease your artificial memory size to allow for the evaluation to finish in time.

## Conclusion

* Well done!

# 4\. Code & Test Cases

* The project does not compile using the build.sh file nor an IDE. After searching I found the run.sh file but this should be clearer!!!
* Put the code inside folder Exercise1.
* The implementation of classical MergeSort is missing.
