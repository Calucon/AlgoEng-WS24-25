\section{Introduction}


\section{Preliminaries}
%Theoretical Knowledge applied here
%The algorithm we are wanting to focus on is External Memory MergeSort, or short EM-MergeSort.
%For the task of sorting data entries we are focusing on MergeSort. It functions by firstly dividing all entries into singular entries, then merging them together into parts and sorting them during that process. With this, we can work on smaller arrays of objects.
Parallelization is a strong tool to 

\section{Algorithm \& Implementation}
%This section provides information about the actually used algorithms and their respective implementations. It should roughly cover the following three topics:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \textbf{Advanced Algorithm:}\\
%		Give and explain the advanced algorithms that you used, and compare them to the basic algorithms.
%	\item \textbf{Implementation:}\\
%		Explain how you implemented these algorithms and state what external libraries you used.
%	\item \textbf{Algorithm Engineering Concepts:}\\
%		State the algorithm engineering concepts that you used and explain why they were helpful (if applicable).
%\end{itemize}



\section{Experimental Evaluation}
The experimental setup for our implementation will be described below.
