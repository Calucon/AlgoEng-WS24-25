# 1\. Assessment

STILL passed

# 2\. General

* You did not provide a test case that is short and concise and that gives meaningful and descriptive output (what your algorithms are actually doing, how many cores are used, etc.), rather they are your experiments for the report.
* Merge Sort was only implemented with outer parallelization.
* Your report does not have enough depth, especially the conclusion is lacking.

# 3\. Report

## Abstract & Introduction

* Very vague and too informal, please be more scientific in your writing.

## Algorithm & Implementation

* No running times are discussed and no pseudocode for further help in understanding the algorithms is provided.
* The algorithms as they are implemented were discussed in detail.

## Experimental Evaluation

* The plots are a bit cryptic, next time consider using better and more understandable labels in your plots. Line plots would have been more expressive for this assignment.

## Conclusion

* Your conclusion is barebones, and doesn't go into detail about why the algorithms perform as they perform.

# 4\. Code & Test Cases

* Your code is all over the place, please place it in the Exercise3 folder next time.
* You used futures and async, next time consider using a library like e.g. OpenMP as it is very easy to use for parallelization.
* Merge sort was only implemented with outer parallelization, however, both outer and inner parallelization were required.
* Your test case as previously said, is no test case but your experiments.
