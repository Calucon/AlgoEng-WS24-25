\section{Introduction}

\section{How to build and run the project}

In order to build the project you must have all requirements installed from the \texttt{README.md} file in the project root directory.
Prior to executing the build script, make sure the that \texttt{gcc} and \texttt{g++} (part of gcc) compiler are either the only compilers installed or that you tell CMake which compilers to use using environment variables.\\
To facilitate this step, we recommend using Visual Studio Code and the CMake Extension.

\section{Preliminaries}
%Theoretical Knowledge applied here
%The algorithm we are wanting to focus on is External Memory MergeSort, or short EM-MergeSort.
%For the task of sorting data entries we are focusing on MergeSort. It functions by firstly dividing all entries into singular entries, then merging them together into parts and sorting them during that process. With this, we can work on smaller arrays of objects.


\section{Algorithm \& Implementation}
%This section provides information about the actually used algorithms and their respective implementations. It should roughly cover the following three topics:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \textbf{Advanced Algorithm:}\\
%		Give and explain the advanced algorithms that you used, and compare them to the basic algorithms.
%	\item \textbf{Implementation:}\\
%		Explain how you implemented these algorithms and state what external libraries you used.
%	\item \textbf{Algorithm Engineering Concepts:}\\
%		State the algorithm engineering concepts that you used and explain why they were helpful (if applicable).
%\end{itemize}
